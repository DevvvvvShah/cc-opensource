Hello, this is Dev! I'm a freshie from Ahmedabad. My hobbies include gaming, reading books and movies! I've also started playing tennis and it's been fun. 

Open source is pretty exciting because with the community, one can make projects that are not possible to be done alone. In fact, the software used to record this, OBS, is open source! It's also useful to find out the issues your project has, with the input of all the community. Helping others is also a good way to learn about open source, i think.
